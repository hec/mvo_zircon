Build and use the Applet.

1. Sources.
	You can find the java source of the Applet in 'src' directory.
	The jar file of 'PDFRENDERER' libraries is in 'jars' directory.  

2. Build and install the Applet.
	You must create a jar file with the java source (compile java source and build jar).
	You must sign the jar which has been created with these command lines :
		'keytool -genkey -alias <alias_name>'
		'jarsigner -signedjar <output.jar> <input.jar> <alias_name>'
		
		Note : The '<output.jar>'  is 'MyPDFViewerApplet.jar', if you want to
			change the name you shoud modify the 'pdf_renderer' view in 
			the 'render' method too.
		
	The jar Applet and the jar PDFRENDERER should be in the same directory.
	As soon as the jar file has been signed you can set these 2 jars in 
	'frameworks/pdf_renderer' directory.
	
		Note: If you want to use the last 'PDFRENDERER' jar (change the name), 
			you must modify the 'pdf_renderer' view in the 'render' method too.

3. Use "Applet".
	You can interact with the Applet like this 'document.getElementById(<appletId>)'.
	There are some methods :
		doFirst() : go to first page
		doPrev() : go to previous page
		doNext() : go to next page
		doLast() : go to last page
		gotoPage(Integer : page) : go to specific page
		getNbPages() : retrieve the number of pages
		doZoom(Integer : factor) : zoom in the document 
									(should be between 0.5 and 1.5, 
									maxWidth < 2000 and minWidth > 100)
		doOpen(String : url) : open the document with the URL (use openURL method)
		openURL(URL : url) : open the document with the url
