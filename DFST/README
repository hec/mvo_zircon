How to Test this module:

You must have ant and Tomcat (or another servlet server) installed. 
If it's not the case see
 - http://ant.apache.org/manual/ to install ant (tested with ant 1.7.1)
 - http://tomcat.apache.org/     to install Tomcat (tested with Tomcat 5)

1) clone or update the mvo_zircon repository
2) create a folder DFST/lib under mvo_zircon
3) put a copy of the file servlet-api.jar in the created folder (or make a
link); it can be found in the Tomcat installation, under lib/
4) run ant
> ant
5) put zircon.war under Tomcat/webapps
6) create a bundle of the mvo_edge application with sc-build inside the mvo_edge main folder
> sc-build
7) copy the application (the static folder under tmp/build/) under Tomcat/webapps
8) in your web browser visit:

http://localhost:8080/static/mvo_edge/en/releasenumber/#test&recid=recordid

releasenumber is the number create by sproutcore
recordid is the id of the record of rerodoc you want to see (you can test for example: 9264, 9263, 9494 or 9171)
